#Project Description
This project involves creating a Python script that utilizes web scraping and API requests to extract data about the top 10 largest economies of the world in terms of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in Billion USD. The script will then process this data using Pandas and Numpy libraries, manipulate it to extract the required information, and finally save the results to a CSV file.

##Objectives
After completing this project, you will be able to:

- Use Webscraping to extract required information from a website.
- Use Pandas to load and process the tabular data as a dataframe.
- Use Numpy to manipulate the information contained in the dataframe.
- Load the updated dataframe to a CSV file.
##Steps Involved
###Step 1: Webscraping
- Use Python libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape a website that provides information about the top economies of the world and their GDP rankings.
###Step 2: Process Data Using Pandas
- Convert the scraped data into a Pandas dataframe.
- Clean and preprocess the data to extract the required information, such as country names and their respective GDPs.
###Step 3: Manipulate Data Using Numpy
- Use Numpy to sort the dataframe in descending order based on GDP values.
- Round the GDP values to 2 decimal places for clarity.
###Step 4: Save Data to CSV
- Save the processed dataframe into a CSV file for future reference or further analysis.
